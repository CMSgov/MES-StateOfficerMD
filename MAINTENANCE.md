# Maintaining the site

This is a **live site**. What that means is edits made to this repository will result in changes being visible on the WWW. For minor edits (spelling corrections, etc.), this is not typically a concern. For major edits, it could be important to test the site locally before committing changes. Why? Because a commit is equivalent to publishing the edits publicly.

## The (simple) workflow

If you find a typo that you want to correct in the site, your workflow will look like this. First, find the page you want to edit. I'll use the `agile.md` file in the `_pages` directory as an example.
